# Automation-Testing-Works
Automation programs For basic webpage using Selenium,Testng,Junit,Jmeter and Postman
This repository contains the automation testing setup and scripts using Selenium, JMeter, and Postman. The goal of this project is to automate functional testing, performance/load testing, and API testing for the application under test.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the automation of web application testing and API testing using the following tools:

Selenium: For browser automation and functional UI testing.
JMeter: For performance and load testing.
Postman: For testing REST APIs and ensuring their functionality and performance.
These automation scripts are designed to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the application through various test cases and scenarios.

Tools Used
Selenium WebDriver: For automating web browsers and testing web applications.
JMeter: For load, performance, and stress testing of the application.
Postman: For automating and testing RESTful API requests.
Java: The programming language used for Selenium and JMeter scripts.
Maven: For dependency management and project build automation.

Setup Instructions

Selenium Setup
Install Java: Make sure you have Java installed. You can download it from here.
IDE: Use any Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Install Selenium WebDriver: Add Selenium WebDriver dependencies to your pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle).
Download Browser Drivers: Ensure the appropriate browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) are downloaded and configured.

JMeter Setup
Download JMeter: Download Apache JMeter from here.
Install JMeter: Unzip the downloaded file and run the JMeter GUI (jmeter.bat for Windows or jmeter.sh for Linux/macOS).
Create JMeter Test Plans: You can create JMeter test plans for load and performance testing of your web applications.

Postman Setup
Download Postman: Install Postman from here.
Import Collections: Import the Postman collections from this repository for testing various API endpoints.
Environment Variables: Configure the Postman environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production).


Automation Testing Workflows
Selenium Web Automation
Selenium is used for automating web-based functional testing. Some of the tests included are:

Login/Logout Tests: Automating login to the application and validating the success of login/logout actions.
Form Automation: Automating the filling of forms, validation of error messages, and submission of data.
UI Element Verification: Ensuring that key UI elements (buttons, links, etc.) are present and functioning as expected.
Example: LoginTest.java

@Test
public void testLogin() {
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver.get("https://www.example.com/login");
    driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("testuser");
    driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys("testpassword");
    driver.findElement(By.id("loginBtn")).click();
    assertTrue(driver.findElement(By.id("logoutBtn")).isDisplayed());
    driver.quit();
}

JMeter Performance Testing
JMeter is used for load and stress testing of the application. The tests include:

Load Testing: Simulating a number of users and measuring how the application performs under normal traffic conditions.
Stress Testing: Testing how the application behaves when pushed beyond normal traffic limits.
Throughput and Latency: Analyzing response times, throughput, and server behavior under load.
Example: load_test.jmx

Thread Group: Simulate a set number of users over a period of time.
HTTP Request Sampler: Define HTTP requests for specific endpoints of the application.
Listeners: Use listeners like "View Results Tree" or "Summary Report" to analyze the test results.

Postman API Testing
Postman is used for API automation, ensuring the APIs return expected responses.

GET/POST/PUT/DELETE Requests: Testing different API request types.
Response Validation: Ensure status codes, headers, and body content match expected results.
Authentication: Testing secured endpoints with various authentication methods like API tokens, OAuth, etc.
Example: GET API Test Script

pm.test("Status is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response includes user data", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.jsonBody('data');
});

Running the Tests
Selenium Tests: You can run Selenium tests directly from your IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ) by running the test classes.
JMeter Tests: Open the .jmx files in the JMeter GUI and click the "Start" button to run the tests.
Postman Tests: Use the Postman app to run the collections or use Newman (Postman’s command-line tool) to run collections via the command line:

newman run api_tests.postman_collection.json
